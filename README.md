## Farmer's market data

Playing with farmer's market data in python. nothing real yet.
uses the current available data from data.gov. the data has 
been converted from xlsx -> csv for convenience.


I'm considering making interesting graphs of uninteresting data
(maybe). The code will change and update rapidly seeing as I just
started this today.
